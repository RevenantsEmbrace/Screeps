Spawns a basic worker:
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].spawnCreep( [WORK, CARRY, MOVE], 'Harvester1' );

Spawn Harvester with HRV Memory Role.
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].spawnCreep([WORK, CARRY, MOVE], 'harvester1', {
  memory: { role: 'HRV' }
});


Let's work on a note for military combat now. We want to be focusing on the potential danger of each "front", these could be general expansion, defence, Invaders and players.
The danger of a front is based on how often attacks from that front happen i.e expansion is going to be 0, defence would also be 0 but invaders and players would work out an average based on a timer.
